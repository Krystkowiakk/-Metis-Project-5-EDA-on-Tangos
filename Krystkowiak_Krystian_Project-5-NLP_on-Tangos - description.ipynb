    "**Design:**\n",
    "\n",
    "The Golden Age of Tango Music is considered to be the period from 1935 to 1955. Many of finest poets that Argentina and Uruguay have ever produced have written Tango lyrics. Quickly the form became one of the richest in Twentieth Century popular culture. And as the lyrics improved in quality, this was also the period when great singers began to emerge, and then to dominate the Tango scene, particularly with the advent of radio, and later sound film. Towards the end of the 60s tango slowly lost its popularity to rock'n roll and pop music.\n",
    "\n",
    "Its 2022 and tango - as a dance - is back! Although most of the music played at novadays milongas is the old music - from the Golden Age, we can observe in last 15 years raise of young, modern orguestras. As those modern bands were starting with covers of old tango creations, now - more and more often - they come up with new songs to keep the tango music alive.\n",
    "\n",
    "Analysis of topics used by various Golden Age poets can help modern orquestras to imitate them and keep spirit of particular orquestras or period. Such exploration is also big intellectual feast for each Argentinian Tango specialist (music collectors, dance teachers) and private passionates."
